# Bonuses

Created: September 18, 2025

Data, methods and analysis of the MLB pre-arbitration player bonus pool.

A manuscript describing the methods and results is forthcoming.

A Shiny App to interactively display results of the analysis is available at: <https://bit.ly/Pre-Arb-Bonus-App>.

Or by using the app.R file in this repository.

For re-use, the analysis files are in order beginning with "01-pitchers.R". Any changes to later-numbered files do not require re-running earlier-numbered files.
